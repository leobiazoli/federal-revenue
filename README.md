# Predicting federal revenue collection for the Brazilian government: an application of time series and neural networks

This work aims to present new alternatives for forecasting federal tax revenues managed by the Federal Revenue Service (SRF), such as classic time series models (ARIMA) and artificial neural networks.

The analyses conducted for federal revenues were developed using the R programming language and are available [here] (https://github.com/leobiazoli/dissertacao/tree/main/psm).
